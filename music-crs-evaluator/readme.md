# Music CRS Evaluator

Official evaluation framework for the **The RecSys Challenge 2026 Conversational Music Recommendation System Challenge**. Music-CRS focuses on the evolving landscape of music discovery, where static recommendation lists are being replaced by dynamic, conversational interactions. As users increasingly interact with AI through natural language, there is a critical need for systems that can seamlessly integrate Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with high-precision Recommender Systems (RecSys). This challenge aims to push the boundaries of how AI understands nuanced user preferences, explores musical tastes through dialogue, and provides contextually relevant track recommendations.

This repository provides standardized tools to evaluate music recommendation systems on the **TalkPlay Data Challenge** datasets. Participants must follow the strict inference JSON format specified below to ensure their submissions can be properly evaluated.

## Overview

The evaluation framework computes two categories of metrics:

- **Retrieval Metrics** — nDCG@{1, 10, 20} evaluated across all 8 conversation turns, macro-averaged over sessions and turns
- **Diversity Metrics** — catalog coverage and response lexical diversity

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies: `datasets`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `tqdm`

### Installation

```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## Quick Start

> **Note — Blind Set Evaluation:**

> Blind set (Blind A / Blind B) evaluation is **not supported** in this repository.

> Submit your predictions to the official leaderboard on **[CodaBench](https://www.codabench.org/)** for blind set scoring.

> Full evaluation on blind sets includes additional metrics that are kept server-side to prevent leakage.

> This repository currently only supports evaluation on the development dataset. For blind set evaluation, please refer to the official baseline code or submit your predictions to the leaderboard as described above.

### 1. Prepare Ground Truth

Before running evaluation, generate the ground truth file for the development set:

```bash
python make_ground_truth.py
```

This saves ground truth to `exp/ground_truth/talkpl_ai_talkplaydata_challenge_dataset/test.json`.

### 2. Place Your Predictions

Save your inference file to:
```
exp/inference/devset/<tid>.json
```

### 3. Run Evaluation

```bash
python evaluate_devset.py --eval_dataset devset --tid <tid>
```

This will:
- Load predictions from `exp/inference/devset/<tid>.json`
- Load ground truth for the development set
- Compute nDCG@{1,10,20} per session and turn
- Compute catalog and lexical diversity
- Save macro-averaged results to `exp/scores/devset/<tid>.json`

For more baselines, see: [nlp4musa/music-crs-baselines](https://github.com/nlp4musa/music-crs-baselines)


## Inference JSON Format

**IMPORTANT:** Participants must strictly follow this JSON format for their predictions.

Your inference results must be saved as a JSON file under `exp/inference/<eval_dataset>/<tid>.json` (e.g. `exp/inference/devset/my_model_devset.json`) with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "session_id": "69137__2020-02-08",
    "user_id": "69137",
    "turn_number": 1,
    "predicted_track_ids": [
      "715f8aff-7c99-46b8-8f9d-6d1aa1ae0372",
      "73562c63-02e3-4278-baf3-aeb3252f8b33",
      "4302b6cf-afe4-45d9-ab72-bd477086d838",
      "f20c5819-a312-4a6d-9ad1-46deccb4ff2f"
    ],
    "predicted_response": "Here are some songs you might enjoy."
  }
]
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session_id` | `string` | Unique session identifier (format: `{user_id}__{date}`) |
| `user_id` | `string` | Unique user identifier |
| `turn_number` | `int` | Conversation turn number (1–8) |
| `predicted_track_ids` | `list[string]` | **Ordered** list of predicted track IDs (up to 20, ranked by relevance) |
| `predicted_response` | `string` | Text response generated by the system (can be empty string) |

### Important Notes

- **One prediction per turn:** Provide predictions for every session × turn in the evaluation set
- **No duplicates:** Each `predicted_track_ids` list must contain unique track IDs
- **Order matters:** Rank track IDs by relevance (most relevant first)
- **Valid track IDs:** IDs must match those in [TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Metadata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Metadata)

## Evaluation Metrics

### Retrieval Metrics

The framework computes **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG)** at k = {1, 10, 20}.

$$
\text{nDCG@k} = \frac{\text{DCG@k}}{\text{IDCG@k}}, \quad \text{DCG@k} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{2^{rel_i} - 1}{\log_2(i + 1)}
$$

- `rel_i` = 1 if the track at position *i* matches the ground truth, 0 otherwise
- IDCG@k is the ideal (maximum possible) DCG@k
- Results are macro-averaged first over turns, then over sessions

### Diversity Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `catalog_diversity` | Unique recommended tracks ÷ total catalog size (0–1). Higher = broader coverage. |
| `lexical_diversity` | **Distinct-2**: unique bigrams ÷ total bigrams across all predicted responses. Higher = richer vocabulary. |

## Dataset

All datasets are part of the [TalkPlay Data Challenge](https://huggingface.co/collections/talkpl-ai/talkplay-data-challenge) collection on Hugging Face.

| Dataset | Size | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| [TalkPlayData-Challenge-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-Challenge-Dataset) | 1k sessions | Multi-turn music conversations with user profiles, conversation goals, and goal-progress assessments |
| [TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Metadata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Metadata) | 50.4k tracks | Track metadata: name, artist, album, tags, popularity, release date |
| [TalkPlayData-Challenge-User-Metadata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-Challenge-User-Metadata) | 9.09k users | User demographics: age, gender, country |
| [TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Embeddings) | 50.4k tracks | Pre-computed embeddings for all tracks |
| [TalkPlayData-Challenge-User-Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-Challenge-User-Embeddings) | 9.09k users | Pre-computed embeddings for all users |

The dataset contains multi-turn conversations (~8 turns each) where the system must recommend music based on conversational context, user listening history, and demographic profile.

## Validation Checklist

Before submitting your predictions, verify:

- [ ] JSON file is saved at the correct path (`exp/inference/devset/<tid>.json`)
- [ ] All required fields are present in every entry
- [ ] Predictions cover all sessions × turns (1–8) in the evaluation set
- [ ] Track IDs are valid identifiers from [TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Metadata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-Challenge-Track-Metadata)
- [ ] No duplicate track IDs within each `predicted_track_ids` list
- [ ] Track IDs are ordered by relevance (most relevant first)
- [ ] JSON is properly formatted (`json.dump(..., ensure_ascii=False)`)

## Troubleshooting

**"Predictions should be unique. Duplicates detected."**
Ensure no duplicate track IDs appear in `predicted_track_ids`.

**Missing predictions error**
Verify predictions exist for all sessions and turn numbers (1–8). Check that `session_id` and `turn_number` match exactly with the ground truth file.

**KeyError on session_id / turn_number**
Confirm your JSON uses the exact field names listed in the Required Fields table above.
